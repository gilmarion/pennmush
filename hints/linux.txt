There are a wide variety of different Linux distributions with a lot
of variation in what packages are installed by default and what their
names are. Some common ones have dependencies described below.

* Debian and derived distributions like Ubuntu split libraries up from
   the other files needed to compile code using them. You'll need to
   install at a minimum the following packages:

  | build-essentials libpcre3-dev libssl-dev 

  Installing libevent-openssl-2.0 is highly recommended as well, but not
  required.  If you want to use SQL, you'll also need the appropriate
  -dev package, like libsqlite3-dev.

* For arch, the mandatory packages are:
   | pcre openssl

   and highly recommended libevent. Some or all of these might already
   be present as part of a base install.
